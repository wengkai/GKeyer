GKeyer
======

*This is an ON-GOING project, under construction! You may try it with your own Arduino now. But it is not fully functional and the code is as ugly as you can not image.*

A Morse code keyer, supports Iambic A/B and strait key, with sidetone, outputs to HF transceiver with key line and FM transceiver with PTT and MIC lines. It has a USB connection to PC and is going to support WinKey protocol in the near further.
